    In a world growing fast, in cities wide and vast, <br/>
    Oyster stands strong, its services unsurpassed.<br/>
    Harnessing data's might, with sensors shining bright,<br/>
    Guiding through day and night, towards waste done right.<br/>
    <br/>
    Bins brim with tales untold, of refuse new and old,<br/>
    Their secrets in our hold, their stories to unfold.<br/>
    In data streams, we dive, where insights thrive,<br/>
    Making our cities come alive, with routes precisely derived.<br/>
    <br/>
    Paths of progress we chart, with our tech-savvy art,<br/>
    Making every start, a journey's smartest part.<br/>
    Through streets both wide and narrow, we lead the sparrow,<br/>
    Turning the waste-laden barrow, into a path straight as an arrow.<br/>
    <br/>
    The pulse of the city, in rhythms gritty,<br/>
    From every alley, park, and committee,<br/>
    We glean, we learn, we create the ditty,<br/>
    Of waste management, smart, efficient, and witty.<br/>
    <br/>
    Oyster, the sentinel of waste, with neither haste nor waste,<br/>
    We transform the landscape, to everyone's taste.<br/>
    In pursuit of a cleaner morrow, we lighten sorrow,<br/>
    Making waste management no longer a row, but a smartly followed furrow.<br/>
    <br/>
    In every corner, in every crease, our efforts never cease,<br/>
    To bring to waste, a peaceful release.<br/>
    With Oyster at hand, across the land,<br/>
    Smart waste management is more than just sand, it's a future so grand.<br/>
